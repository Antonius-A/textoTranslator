# textoTranslator

##Description:
A very simple english to french, spanish, etc. python program that makes translating text or text files quick and easy.

##Installation:
This is a PyCharm project. Open it in PyCharm and run the following command in the terminal:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Now youre good to go!

##Limitations:
1.  Reverso APIs for python are currently not so great. I used reverso_context_api which tested as the best. It only translates small strings.
2.  Will be using the translate-api module for future versions to access more translation services. For this version I used the translate library.
